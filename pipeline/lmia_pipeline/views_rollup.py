"""Nightly roll-up of the Worker's audience counts into files kept in R2.

Why: Workers Analytics Engine keeps a data point for three months, so the
counts the Worker writes (site/src/views.ts, dataset lmia_watch_views) would
be gone a quarter after they were taken. Once a night this asks the SQL API
for each finished UTC day the summary does not hold yet (normally only
yesterday) and keeps the answer: one CSV per day (`<day>.csv`) and one row
per day in `summary.csv`. The workflow uploads both under `views/` in R2.

What a stored row can hold: only what the Worker writes, which is the route
template, the kind of request, the page language, the country code
Cloudflare's edge attaches, the referring site's host name, the status, for
an Atom feed the file name and the subscriber count a feed reader stated,
and since 2026-10-30 whether the request came from a bot or a person and the
person's device class. The Worker never writes an IP address, a user agent,
a cookie, a full referrer or a raw path, so no query can read one back. Each
value read is checked against the shape the Worker writes before it reaches
a file, so a row cannot carry more than that even if the dataset ever did.

People and bots (since 2026-10-30): the summary's human_* columns count page
views below status 400 by requests the Worker marked "human", bot_pages
those it marked "bot". unique_visitors and human_visits count distinct daily
visitor codes (blob10): the queries ask only for how many there are
(count(DISTINCT)), so no code ever leaves Analytics Engine. A day on which
any page view carries no bot flag (the days before the flag, and the day it
was deployed) gets blanks in every one of those columns, never figures that
would undercount; a day on which any person's request carries no code (no
VIEWS_SALT_KEY, or the secret set part way through the day) gets blank
visitor columns. A blank means "not counted", a 0 means none.

Why a day is caught up rather than only yesterday: a night whose query fails
leaves a gap, and nothing should need a manual step to fill it. Each night
rolls up every day after the newest one in the summary, back to the three
months Analytics Engine still holds (all of them on the first night, which
keeps the counts written before the roll-up existed). A day with no data
points at all is not written: an empty day means the counting failed, not
that nobody came, and the next night asks again. Queries are per day: one
for the totals by kind, and six more only for a day that has data points.

Why "failed" never stops the run: the counts are a record of the audience,
not part of the data refresh. The step reports the outcome in the run status
and the next night catches up.

Readings taken on the night, on the row for yesterday only: the Bluesky
follower count (the public profile endpoint, no token); the X follower count
once a month, on the row for a month's last day, when X posting is enabled
(X_POST_ENABLED and the four X secrets), since a profile read costs a credit
under X's pay-per-use API; and the site's employer and record counts from
tonight's stats.json. A row rolled up again without a reading keeps the one
it had.
