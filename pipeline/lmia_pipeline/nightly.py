"""Checks and the run status for the nightly workflow.

The workflow calls these between its steps so that a failure anywhere never
publishes broken or empty data, never replaces a good backup with a worse
one, and always leaves a status file the site's daily check can read.

  restore   pick the database to start from: the backup, else the previous
            backup when the newest is damaged, else the newest weekly
            snapshot when both nightly files are missing or damaged, else
            (only when nothing exists anywhere) an empty one. Exits 1 when a
            backup exists but cannot be used, so the run stops before it
            rebuilds from nothing.
  verify    check tonight's database and export; writes db_ok and export_ok
            for the save and deploy steps (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set).
  status    write status.json from the run's log rows, the workflow steps'
            outcomes and the checks, whatever state the run ended in.
  pack      write the backup the save step uploads: a copy of the database
            without its secondary indexes, checked and gzipped. Exits 1 when
            the copy fails its check or the file is above the upload cap.
  gate      for a retry trigger: skip=true when today's run already
            finished clean (resilience.gate).
  live-version
            the Worker version serving traffic, from Wrangler's JSON, kept
            for a rollback.
  smoke     fetch the live site after a deploy: verdict ok, broken or
            unverifiable (resilience.smoke).
  checks    the monthly expiry checks of the tokens and the domain.
  attention list the items needing attention and write the GitHub issue's
            texts; exits 1 when there are any.
  site-bundle-check
            for the site-only deploy (deploy-site.yml): compare the data
            files of an unpacked static.tar.gz with the ones the live site
            serves (resilience.bundle_check). Exits 1 on any difference, a
            missing file or an answer other than 200, so that workflow
            stops before its deploy or rolls it back after.

The R2 transfers stay in the workflow, apart from the weekly snapshot's
listing and download, which Wrangler has no command for; these commands read
the files the workflow leaves. verify, status, gate, live-version, smoke and
checks report what they find in their output and never stop the run.
